This is a self-done project to practice creating a website with common features found in both blogs and many social media sites.

Upcoming updates:
1) Public Notes
2) Friends
3) Move the notes page to its own path (change '/' path to '/notes')
  a) Notes will have an extension (eg. '/notes/edit') to edit and delete
  notes
4) Home page will display your own notes and notes created by friends
5) Add friend groups
6) Improve search bar to redirect to a search page if the user doesn't exist

Issues:
1) Adding tags in the notes-page requires me to relabel the tags
in the query set before putting them in the context. If not done,
the html shows "Queryset <tag1, tag2>" instead of just tag1, tag2.


Implemented features:
1) Login/Registration
2) Settings page to update personal info
3) Notes with a manytomany link with tags
  a) Notes displayed with cards and can be added in the home screen
4) Basic search bar (Enter user and it brings you to their profile page)
